<p>As part of a well-baby or well-child visit, your child’s doctor should perform a “developmental screening,” asking specific questions about your baby’s progress. The<a href="http://www.nichd.nih.gov/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</a> (NICHD) lists five behaviors that warrant further evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not babble or coo by 12 months</li>
<li>Does not gesture (point, wave, grasp) by 12 months</li>
<li>Does not say single words by 16 months</li>
<li>Does not say two-word phrases on his or her own by 24 months</li>
<li>Has any loss of any language or social skill at any age</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these five “red flags” does not mean your child has autism. But <strong>because the disorder’s symptoms vary so widely, a child showing these behaviors should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team.</strong> This team might include a neurologist, psychologist, developmental pediatrician, speech/language therapist, learning consultant or other professionals who are knowledgeable about autism.</p>
